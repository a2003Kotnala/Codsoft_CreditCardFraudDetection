***Credit Card Fraud Detection 🛡️***

This project is a Credit Card Fraud Detection system developed using machine learning and data analysis techniques. Its primary objective is to identify fraudulent credit card transactions among a vast number of legitimate ones. Credit card fraud detection is crucial for ensuring the security of financial transactions and protecting customers from unauthorized charges. 💳

***Overview 📋***

In this project, we leverage machine learning and data analysis to build a robust system for detecting credit card fraud. The dataset used for this purpose contains information about credit card transactions, including various features such as:

- Transaction Amount
- Transaction Date and Time
- Merchant Information
- Customer Information

The project includes the following key components:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis and modeling.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing and visualizing data to gain insights.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features and transforming existing ones.
4. Machine Learning Model: Building and training a predictive model for fraud detection.
5. Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using relevant metrics.
